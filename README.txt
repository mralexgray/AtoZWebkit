Thank you for your interest in the DeskBrowse source code!

DISCLAIMER: This code was written in 2005-2006 by a couple of teenagers who were new to programming in general, and therefore isn't the best example of clean readable code. In fact, why you would want to even look at this code is a mystery to both of us. This code in no way represents our current level of programming ability and should really only be consumed on an entertainment basis only.

Have fun!
